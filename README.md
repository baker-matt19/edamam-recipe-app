This is a website I built to showcase my web development skills. It's a simple web app where i built a proxy server with node and npm to use the edamam api. I used React.js for the front end and Node.js npm and express for the backend. I believe it to be a quick simple display of my ability to build websites and applications using React.js and Node.js.

To install and run make sure you have Node.js and npm installed with the latest versions. 

Then with your directory in the server use run npx-dev. Now the server should be running.

Then with your directory in the client folder input npm start. And boom the site should start in your browser or at localhost: 3000.
